# Getting API Keu

Before you can use our API, you have to get your secret key. You can access http://www.tiket.com/affiliate and enter your detail information there. After submitting, you will receive your username, password and API key. This account can be used for affiliate program and reseller program.

When you are done implementing this, we will require you to go through some UAT tests (user acceptance test). This test is to ensure that you have properly implement our API and booking flow untuk payment. Detail of the UAT test cases can be downloaded here.

We have two URL with totally different server data:

API development : [api-sandbox.tiket.com](http://api-sandbox.tiket.com)
API production : [api.tiket.com](https://api.tiket.com)

Both might have different content, so please don’t compare api-sandbox.tiket.com data with the real data at www.tiket.com

Attention :

We require you to send header data user-agent when requesting API using the following format:

<aside class="warning">twh:[BUSINESS_ID];[BUSINESS_NAME]</aside>

All API request without this format will be blocked by the firewall.

Welcome to the Kittn API! You can use our API to access Kittn API endpoints, which can get information on various cats, kittens, and breeds in our database.

We have language bindings in Shell, Ruby, and Python! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

This example API documentation page was created with [Slate](https://github.com/tripit/slate). Feel free to edit it and use it as a base for your own API's documentation.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
