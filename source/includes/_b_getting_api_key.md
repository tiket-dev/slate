# Getting API Key

Before you can use our API, you have to get your secret key. You can access http://www.tiket.com/affiliate and enter your detail information there. After submitting, you will receive your username, password and API key. This account can be used for affiliate program and reseller program.

When you are done implementing this, we will require you to go through some UAT tests (user acceptance test). This test is to ensure that you have properly implement our API and booking flow untuk payment. Detail of the UAT test cases can be downloaded here.
